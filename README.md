<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<div align="center">
<a href="https://www.formulalsu.com/">
  <img src="images/trlogo.PNG">
</a>
</div>
<br />

To improve upon previous years' racing performance by designing and implementing a full electrical harness and sensor suite capable of electronic throttle control and advanced driver assistance features in order to place at the top of the Dynamic Events leaderboard at FSAE Michigan 2022.


Included in this repo:
* Any matlab code used for calculations or simulink modeling
* x
* Machine Learning implementation for fuel map optimization.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
