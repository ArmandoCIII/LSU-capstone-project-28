<br />

To improve upon previous years' racing performance by designing and implementing a full electrical harness and sensor suite capable of electronic throttle control and advanced driver assistance features in order to place at the top of the Dynamic Events leaderboard at FSAE Michigan 2022.


Included in this repo:
* Matlab code used for calculations or simulink modeling
* SPICE
* Machine Learning implementation for fuel map optimization.

### Built With

Below is a list of tools used to create, simulate, and run all files contained within the repo. Please keep in mind that many of the file requirements are independent of one another. For example, the neural networks require Python and its listed packages, but not Matlab.

Refer to the ["Getting Started"](#getting-started) section for more information.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)
  * [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
  * [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
  * [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/)


* [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

* [Spice](https://www.orcad.com/products/orcad-pspice-designer/overview)
